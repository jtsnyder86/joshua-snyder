  The Modit Dashboard is a companion application to Neurotype Inc's Modit Mobile application.  The dashboard is a hub to access the data collected from the mobile application user in order to provide a visualized chart of that data. The data is then used by research/clinic professionals to evaluate triggers and prescribe the most effective therapies to address issues of substance abuse and addiction. Data in it's raw form can be exported as well for use in other research analysis. The dashboard is developed with different levels of users that have varying degrees of access to patient/participant data and information. This application was developed for use by Neurotype Inc. which is a research organization specializing in R&D for substance abuse and addiction.

  My Client Aid is an application that was developed with therapists in mind who record their own mindfulness audio for clients. The application has client user and admin user capabilities for two levels of access. The admin has the ability to upload an audio file to the local server and save the path in the database. The admin user can then assign audio files to a client based on their needs. The client user has access to the audio files assigned to them through their own account. Future plans include incorporating a cloud database such as AWS S3 and other possible features for the clients such as notes.
